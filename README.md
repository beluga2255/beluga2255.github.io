# Andromeda Search

Andromeda is a *VERY* basic HTML based search engine. It goes with my WIP operating system called *Birbuntu*. I made it because I felt other search engines were to cluttered.


### How To Use As Your New Tab

I use this extension for firefox: https://www.soeren-hentzschel.at/firefox-webextensions/new-tab-override/?utm_campaign=webext&utm_term=newtaboverride. You simply use https://beluga2255.github.io as the URL. 


### Alternative For Chrome Users

For Chrome, I find that this extension works well, and once again, you use https://beluga2255.github.io as the URL: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/custom-new-tab-url/mmjbdbjnoablegbkcklggeknkfcjkjia


### And Since I Can't Wait...

The first person to view this wins a free ticket to making me happy:)


#### ***NOTE:***

This is not a real search engine, it uses google to actually do the searching. It is just a really nice new tab skin.
